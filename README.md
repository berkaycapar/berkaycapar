### about

School is finished; but I am a computer engineering student who has not graduated because of his internship. Apart from general projects such as Python, Java, C, C ++, C #, SQL, I also worked with ROS (Robot Operating System), big data and machine learning. Apart from general algorithm analysis, I also have an idea about technologies such as Tableau and Spark. I have completed the lessons I have taken on this subject with AA, I also participated in the hackathon of THY and got an idea about the operation. Same time, I am following the Kaggle platform and its competitions. I have done some minor work in Android Studio and XCode for Android and iOS, which also includes RESTFull. I also entered the Swift programming language; Also, although I started React-Native for the first time in hybrid coding, I am currently working on Flutter with the Dart programming language. Like other engineers, I am a person who wants to improve himself more and more and learn more quickly. I have no problem presenting the aspects I have developed in this regard on the community side. I adapt to my environment and can communicate well with people. My empathy power is high. Therefore, my social relations are strong. I can approach problems not only mathematically, but also socially analytically. With my ambition and perseverance, I can produce good results as a trigger for the development of a competitive environment.
